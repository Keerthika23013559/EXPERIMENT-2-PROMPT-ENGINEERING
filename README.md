## REG NO: 212223240071
## Aim:
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

## Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Start the experiment.

Step 2: Select a test scenario (e.g., General Knowledge, Creative Writing, Problem Solving, or Data Analysis).

Step 3: Frame two types of prompts for the chosen scenario:

Broad / Unstructured Prompt.

Refined / Structured Prompt.

Step 4: Input the Broad Prompt into the AI model and record the generated response.

Step 5: Input the Refined Prompt into the AI model and record the generated response.

Step 6: Compare the two outputs on the basis of:

Step 7: Repeat Steps 2–6 for multiple scenarios.

Step 8: Document the findings in a tabular format (Broad vs Refined output).

Step 9: Analyze which type of prompting yields better quality responses.

Step 10: Conclude the experiment.
## Output
Scenario 1: General Knowledge
Broad Prompt : “Tell me about Artificial Intelligence.”

## Result
Broad prompts give general and creative outputs but lack focus.Refined prompts provide accurate, structured, and context-specific results.Overall, refined prompting improves quality, accuracy, and clarity, while broad prompting is better for brainstorming.
