## Aim: 
Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Start the experiment.

Step 2: Select a test scenario (e.g., General Knowledge, Creative Writing, Problem Solving, or Data Analysis).

Step 3: Frame two types of prompts for the chosen scenario:

Broad / Unstructured Prompt

Refined / Structured Prompt

Step 4: Input the Broad Prompt into the AI model and record the generated response.

Step 5: Input the Refined Prompt into the AI model and record the generated response.

Step 6: Compare the two outputs on the basis of:

Accuracy,Depth,Relevance,Conciseness,Creativity / Originality

Step 7: Repeat Steps 2–6 for multiple scenarios.

Step 8: Document the findings in a tabular format (Broad vs Refined output).

Step 9: Analyze which type of prompting yields better quality responses.

Step 10: Conclude the experiment.
## Output
Scenario 1: Creative Writing

Broad Prompt: Write a 100-word story about an AI robot who wants to become human, in a humorous tone.

Scenario 6: Comparative Analysis

Broad Prompt: “Compare cats and dogs.”

Refined Prompt: “Compare cats and dogs in a table showing temperament, maintenance, and trainability.”

Scenario 7: Role-based Explanation

Broad Prompt: “Explain photosynthesis.”

Refined Prompt: “You are a science teacher. Explain photosynthesis to a 12-year-old in simple words using an example.”

## Result

Broad prompts give general and creative outputs but lack focus. Refined prompts provide accurate, structured, and context-specific results. Overall, refined prompting improves quality, accuracy, and clarity, while broad prompting is better for brainstorming.
